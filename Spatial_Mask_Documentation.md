## Introduction

Spatial Mask is a web-based AR application that enables users to experience different superhero masks through their device's camera. The project combines computer vision, face tracking, and web technologies to create an interactive and engaging user experience.

### Problem Statement

Traditional photo filters are static and limited in their interaction. Users want a more immersive and interactive way to experience different character masks in real-time.

### Solution

Spatial Mask provides a real-time AR experience where users can:

- Try on different superhero masks
- See the masks track their facial movements
- Capture photos with the masks
- Switch between different masks seamlessly

## Features

### 1. Real-time Face Tracking

- Uses MediaPipe Face Mesh for accurate face detection
- Tracks 468 facial landmarks
- Provides smooth mask alignment with facial features

### 2. Multiple Mask Options

- Iron Man Mask
  - Red and gold color scheme
  - Glowing arc reactor
  - Angular eye design
- Batman Mask
  - Black base with bat ears
  - White eye holes
  - Yellow bat symbol
- Spider-Man Mask
  - Red base with web pattern
  - White eye holes with web design
  - Dynamic web lines
- Shakthi Man Mask
  - Blue base design
  - White eye holes
  - Glowing lightning bolt symbol

### 3. Interactive Controls

- Camera toggle (front/back)
- Music control
- Photo capture
- Mask selection buttons

### 4. Audio Integration

- Background music support
- Music toggle functionality
- Volume control

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Technologies

## Implementation Details

### Face Tracking System

```javascript
// Face mesh initialization
faceMesh = new FaceMesh({
  locateFile: (file) => {
    return `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/face_mesh/${file}`;
  },
});

// Configuration
faceMesh.setOptions({
  maxNumFaces: 1,
  refineLandmarks: true,
  minDetectionConfidence: 0.5,
  minTrackingConfidence: 0.5,
});
```

### Mask Rendering

Each mask is implemented using Canvas 2D API:

- Dynamic scaling based on face size
- Real-time position updates
- Custom effects and animations

### Audio System

```javascript
// Audio control implementation
function toggleMusic() {
  if (isMusicPlaying) {
    bgMusic.pause();
    musicButton.textContent = 'ðŸ”Š';
  } else {
    bgMusic.play();
    musicButton.textContent = 'ðŸ”‡';
  }
  isMusicPlaying = !isMusicPlaying;
}
```

## User Guide

### Getting Started

1. Open the application in a modern web browser
2. Click "Start AR Experience"
3. Grant camera permissions when prompted
4. Select a mask using the buttons at the bottom
5. Use the control buttons for additional features

### Controls

- ðŸ”Š Music Toggle: Play/pause background music
- ðŸ“¸ Photo: Capture current view
- ðŸ”„ Camera: Switch between front and back cameras
- Mask Buttons: Switch between different masks

### Best Practices

1. Ensure good lighting for better face tracking
2. Keep face within camera frame
3. Maintain a stable internet connection
4. Use modern browsers for best performance
